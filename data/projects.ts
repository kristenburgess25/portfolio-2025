Essentially, instead of having a gridded page of products to peruse, our users could create interactive rooms to show off products. This could be achieved through arranging 3D product images in a space, or by using an image of a space (for example, an actual showroom or a digital mockup) and creating interactive hotspots. The platform could be linked with Shopify to import all products to create a custom headless Shopify storefront, with its own custom Shopify checkout experience. Users could also link to their Instagram accounts to import social media content and feeds to include in their store experience. With this integration, the platform was also used by content creators who could create a room with links to product partnerships.",

The goal was to replace the outdated default gift card experience with a more flexible, thoughtful solution. From a customer's perspective, Govalo allows you to choose a gift design, schedule delivery to a recipient, and include a personalized message — all inside the Shopify checkout flow. On the backend, we built robust merchant-facing tools for branding, fulfillment, and tracking. Govalo is publicly available in the Shopify App Store and used by a growing number of merchants to create a more human and polished gifting experience.",
